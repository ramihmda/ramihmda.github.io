## Overview
Built a custom 3D printing and air-dispensing system for fabricating stretchable liquid-metal strain sensors with high repeatability.

## My Role
Undergraduate Research Assistant — system integration, software architecture, and control.

## Technical Highlights
- wxPython GUI for real-time parameter control
- Modular ROS2 node architecture
- G-code registration for mold-based fabrication
