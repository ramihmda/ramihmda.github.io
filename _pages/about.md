I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at UT Austin, working as an undergraduate research assistant in the [ARTS Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/arts-lab/) (Advanced Robotic Technologies for Surgery).

My work focuses on control software and system integration for medical robotics — embedded firmware, sensor integration, and control interfaces for testing and calibration.
